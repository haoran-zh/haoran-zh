### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Haoran Zhang. 
- I'm a master's student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University.
- In June 2019, I earned my bachelor's degree in Automation from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), China. 
- Fun fact: My hometown is Xinxiang, Henan. In Chinese, "Xin" means "New", and "Xiang" means "York" ðŸ˜„
- What is HUST? Well, not as famous as Tsinghua or PKU, but it is also a very top university in my home country. Rank 6th in China / 109th in the world by USNews, and 8th in China / 96th in the world by ShanghaiRanking.
